    <h3>Hello</h3>
    <p>
      Hello, this is Caden Miller. <br>
      Here is my first ever blog. It's been about 9 months since I created this website with the intent of having a blogging feature.
      I simply never got around to actually writing anything. 
    </p>

    <h3>Philosophy of a Blog</h3>
    <p>
      Writing brings up my questions about wether anything that I would write has any worth.
      Has someone else not said what I have and am going to say with better and more eloquent wording.
      Will any of it really matter? I say yes, because if I don't express myself in ways then I only prove that it doesn't matter. 
      On the small, small chance that something that I say has some matter to someone else, then it does.
      Therefore I should share my opinion because if I don't then there is no point.
    </p>

    <h3>My Opinions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>I think that everyone should keep an open mind.</li>
      <li>I think that anyone should have and express their opinion without fear.</li>
      <li>I think that technology has the potential to save us all, we need to choose how to use it.</li>
      <li>I think that we need to make decisions to help ourselves and the world and that they are not conflicting goals.</li>
      <li>I think that anyone can make a decision as long as they do not harm or take away rights from others.</li>
      <li>I think that billionaires should not exist.</li>
      <li>I think that we can save the world, but that is not possible alone.</li>
      <li>I think that humans are naturally good.</li>
      <li>I think that only though standardization can we create useful systems.</li>
      <li>I think that (almost) all software should be open source.</li>
      <li>I think that everyone should value people, as they are not means to an end.</li>
      <li>I think that money should not exist, there are better ways.</li>
      <li>I think that we need to focus on earth and not ourselves.</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>What am I doing?</h3>
    <h4>Film</h4>
    <p>
      These days I've been working on film projects with my teachers from Highschool Mr. Pridy and Ms. Cross. 
      There is a whole crew working on these projects that they do and I'm honored to be working with them.
      It makes me so happy to feel like I'm creating something with someone.
      Usually I create things alone or only with one or two people.
      While those smaller projects are important to me it's much more pleasing to work on projects that feel like more to me.
    </p>
    <h4>Coding</h4>
    <p>
      I am creating other coding projects that I also enjoy doing like this website and C++ projects.
      C++ is one of my favorite languages and currently I'm using the latest cpp20 and looking forward to the newer cpp23 standards.
      I prefer the static languages that are compiled because they give you errors before you run the code.
      <br>
      <br>
      Here is a list of some of my favorite languages:
      <ul>
        <li>C++ (Versions 11 to 20)</li>
        <li>English (Version 2023)</li>
        <li>C (Versions ANSI C89, ISO C99)</li>
        <li>Java (Provisionally)</li>
        <li>Others...</li>
      </ul>

    </p>

    <h3>Goodbye</h3>
